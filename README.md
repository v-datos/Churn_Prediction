# Bank Customer Churn Prediction (group assigment)

Introduction
Customer Churn for a bank is a degree of customer inactivity or disengagement that is observed by the bank over a certain amount of time, which is also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection. It is a crucial business metric broadly used by Banks, insurance companies, streaming services companies, and telecom service companies as the cost of retaining existing customers is much less than acquiring a new one. The main causes of customer churn in the Bank industry include unhappiness with customer service, unreasonable fees, incompatible plans, and poor support. The capacity to forecast whether or not a certain client is at high risk of churning while there is still time to intervene provides a substantial extra potential revenue source for banks.

ABC Bank is one of the banks that are concerned about their customer churn rate. With an increased number of customers leaving the bank, they decided to collect the data for the 6 months of the year 2016. 10,000 customers are selected randomly among three countries - France, Germany, and Spain. The bank is looking to get insights into customer churning so that the bank can upgrade or adopt new policies.

Objectives
The main objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts who is likely to churn so that ABC Bank may go out of its way to give better service and influence consumer retention. By testing various classification models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, we are aiming to choose the model that performs best.

Datasets
For this analysis, we used the Bank Customer Churn Dataset of ABC Bank downloaded from Kaggle. It has 10,000 rows across 12 Columns. Most Columns are related to personal customer information ranging from Age, Credit Score, Estimated Salary, Gender, Tenure with the bank, and more.
